					About the Legend
				</h4>
				<ul>
					☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
					Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
					was born on October 15, 1931, in
					Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
					☛ He served as the 11th President
					of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
					☛ Kalam earned a degree in
					aeronautical engineering from the
					Madras Institute of Technology and in
					1958 joined the Defence Research and
					Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
					☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
					Space Research Organisation, where he
					was project director of the SLV-III, the
					first satellite launch vehicle that was
					both designed and produced in India.
					<br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
					Kalam planned the program that produced
					a number of successful missiles, which
					helped earn him the nickname <strong>
					“Missile Man.”</strong>
					<br><br> ☛ Among those successes
					was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
					ballistic missile, which incorporated
					aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
					in 1989.
					<br><br> ☛ He also played a
					pivotal organisational, technical,
					and political role in India's Pokhran-II
					nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
					the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
					<br><br> ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
					was scientific adviser to the defense
					minister, and he later served as principal
					scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
					government with the rank of cabinet minister.
					<br><br> ☛ His prominent role in
					the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
					solidified India as a nuclear power and
					established Kalam as a national hero,
					although the tests caused great concern
					in the international community.
					<br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
					forward a countrywide plan called
					Technology Vision 2020, which he described
					as a road map for transforming India from
					a less-developed to a developed society
					in 20 years. The plan called for, among
					other measures, increasing agricultural
					productivity, emphasizing technology as
					a vehicle for economic growth, and
					widening access to health care and
					education.
					<br><br> ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b>
					honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
					universities. The Government of India
					honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
					in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
					in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
					DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
					to the Government.
					<br><br> ☛ In 1997, Kalam received
					India's highest civilian honour, the
					Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
					the scientific research and modernisation
					of defence technology in India.
					<br><br> ☛ In 2013, he was the
					recipient of the Von Braun Award from
					the National Space Society "to recognize
					excellence in the management and leadership
					of a space-related project".
					<br><br> ☛ While delivering a
					lecture at the Indian Institute of
					Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
					died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
					<b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
					<br><br> ☛ Wheeler Island, a
					national missile test site in Odisha, was
					renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
					2015.
					<br><br> ☛ A prominent road in
					New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
					Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
					in August 2015.
					<br><br> ☛ In February 2018,
					scientists from the Botanical Survey
					of India named a newly found plant
					species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
					honour.
